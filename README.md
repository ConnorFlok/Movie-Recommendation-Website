# Movie-Recommendation-Website
The Movie Recommendation Website is a web application that helps users discover new films based on genres, cast, keywords, and viewing preferences. The system uses data from the TMDb API, applies TFâ€“IDF and cosine similarity for content-based recommendations, and uses K-Means clustering to group similar movies.
